## Review and implementation progress

| Layer | State |
|---|---|
| Cross-repository stages 0–1 | Reviewed |
| Stage 2: capabilities and exclusions | In progress |
| Stages 3–6: architecture through hardware validation | Not started |
| Stage 7: firmware design | Not started |
| Stage 8: UI, safety, and legal controls | Not started |
| Firmware implementation | Not started |

The canonical stage table is [`docs/review/stages.md`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/stages.md). No firmware architecture, toolchain, protocol, directory structure, or implementation claim is accepted yet.

## Accepted target constraints

- all-in-one product profile, the install-time non-aggression pledge, and three functional levels (`DEC-0002`, `DEC-0010`);
- conservative TX defaults and explicit selection of maximum available power (`DEC-0003`);
- reconsideration of legally and technically feasible legacy exclusions (`DEC-0004`);
- cost optimization only with proof of no product loss (`DEC-0005`);
- external M5 GNSS and external U214 LoRa+GNSS (`DEC-0006`, `DEC-0008`);
- an NMEA baseline and a conditional per-revision advanced CASIC profile without another GNSS (`DEC-0014`);
- an FM/RDS/ordinary-AM baseline and an open owner-imported SSB/CW patch loader without a bundled blob (`DEC-0015`);
- a conditional SA518 dual-band analog-voice target with an honest UHF-only SA868S fallback (`DEC-0016`);
- external M5 Unit NFC U216 as the first HF NFC backend, RFID2 as limited compatibility, and custom PN7160 as a qualification fallback (`DEC-0017`);
- dual-path consumer IR on C5 with TSOP38238 robust RX and TSMP95000 measured-carrier learning from 30 to 60 kHz (`DEC-0018`);
- calibrated three-antenna nRF24 RPD hit-rate sector comparison without invented RSSI/dBm, bearing, or VSWR (`DEC-0019`);
- onboard mono ES8311 audio with hardware-default analog bypass (`DEC-0009`);
- target C5 ownership of 3×nRF24 and IR (`DEC-0001`), without a claim that the inter-MCU transport is solved.
- owner-controlled signed S3/C5 updates with rollback and an open developer lifecycle (`DEC-0013`), without enabling irreversible hardware lockdown.

## Open engineering dependencies

- `FND-0001`: C5's single general-purpose SPI controller cannot perform both legacy nRF-master and S3↔C5-slave roles.
- `FND-0002`: the BLE owner conflicts between legacy repositories.
- `FND-0003`: the audio direction is accepted, but pins, electrical behavior, drivers, HIL, and feature-level gates are not yet proven.
- `FND-0006`: the proposed key matrix and accepted audio controls collide on `U13.P10..P17`.
- `FND-0007`: the current STOP button is only an I²C-expander input and cannot independently kill TX.
- `FND-0011`: SA868 now has PTT receive-default, PD power-down-default, and a physical low-power H/L ceiling; independent STOP and controllable high power still require stage-3 proof.
- `FND-0013`: VOX has no microphone-capture path and is explicitly deferred to the consolidated audio/pin budget.
- `FND-0015`: both documented M5 NFC Units require a 5 V PORT.A power profile, while current hardware `J40/J41` provide 3.3 V; the electrical correction awaits the consolidated port/power design.
- `FND-0017`: the legacy IR source still has S3 ownership, an unqualified generic emitter/current path, and no proved STOP/TX-state/optical behavior. Its false `FAB-READY` label was removed and Q58 now has a reset-safe pull-down.
- `FND-0019`: the three generic nRF24 PA/LNA placeholders still use the S3 bus, exact modules/STOP/TX detectors are absent, and the post-dual-IR C5 resource budget is unproved. False `FAB-READY` labels were removed and shared CE now has a reset-safe pull-down.
- `FND-0021`: ESB/MouseJack/KeySniffer/BLE-compatible/interference claims require separate capability, security, licence, and HIL gates; no active C5 implementation currently proves them.
- `FND-0022`: the C5 hardware source was corrected from legacy N8R4/the false ANT2 feed to current N8R8 and the stock ANT1 path, but exact antenna/power/STOP/TX-live/EMC/AVL proof remains open.
- `FND-0023`: public C5 Wi-Fi raw TX does not support arbitrary management/deauth and `AUTO` is not simultaneous dual band; a patched vendor binary needs a separate provenance/licence/update/HIL boundary.
- `FND-0024`: the country/DFS/PMF/privacy state machine is not implemented; DFS SoftAP is excluded by the current contract.
- `FND-0025`: raw/full-stack 802.15.4 is technically broader than the legacy passive-only ceiling, but ordinary Thread/Zigbee scope and shared-radio coexistence await `IMP-0018`.
- Legacy firmware documents and source candidates remain non-authoritative until their producing stages are reviewed.

## Current review work

The System/UI/storage capability slice is **Reviewed** under `REV-0002I`.

The GNSS/navigation slice [`REQ-GNSS-0001`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/requirements/REQ-GNSS-0001-navigation-integrity.md) is **Reviewed** under `REV-0002K`. The owner accepted `IMP-0012/A` as [`DEC-0014`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/decisions/DEC-0014-casic-gnss-profile.md): NMEA is the mandatory baseline of a qualified profile, while assistance and receiver-reported jamming/spoofing remain conditional on exact revision/firmware proof. Unsupported, timeout, and parser error mean `unknown`, not “no threat,” and host heuristics are kept distinct from receiver status.

`FND-0009` is closed at requirement level. UART/power hardware, parser, assistance source, actual Unit/U214 advanced-message support, RF self-desense, and HIL remain unimplemented evidence for later stages.

The Si4732 slice [`REQ-RX-0001`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/requirements/REQ-RX-0001-si4732-receiver.md) is **Reviewed** under `REV-0002M`. The owner accepted `IMP-0013/A` as [`DEC-0015`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/decisions/DEC-0015-open-si4732-ssb-patch-loader.md): an open bounded loader is in the target, the SSB blob is locally imported with distinct integrity/provenance states, and synchronous AM remains deferred pending separate proof. `FND-0010` is closed at requirement level; RF/frontend, patch rights/compatibility, loader, audio/storage/decoder, and coexistence HIL remain unimplemented.

The analog-voice slice [`REQ-VHF-0001`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/requirements/REQ-VHF-0001-analog-voice-modem.md) is **Reviewed** under `REV-0002O`. The owner accepted `IMP-0014/A` as [`DEC-0016`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/decisions/DEC-0016-conditional-sa518-dual-band-voice.md): SA518 is the preferred 136–174/400–470 MHz half-duplex analog-FM target, while SA868S remains an explicitly UHF-only fallback until price, supply, PCB/power, and conducted-RF qualification pass. The peak 2 W-class→1 W trade is accepted and is not recorded as zero-loss saving. `FND-0012` is closed at requirement level; microphone capture/VOX (`FND-0013`), independent STOP, high-power control, exact hardware, protocol, RF, audio, and HIL proof remain for later stages.

The NFC/RFID slice [`REQ-NFC-0001`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/requirements/REQ-NFC-0001-hf-nfc-rfid.md) is **Reviewed** under `REV-0002Q`. The owner accepted `IMP-0005/A` as [`DEC-0017`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/decisions/DEC-0017-u216-hf-nfc-backend.md): the external $7 M5 Unit NFC U216 is the first HF NFC target, the $4.95 RFID2 is limited compatibility, and custom PN7160 is a fallback only after qualification failure. The $2.05 accessory delta is accepted to retain A/B/F/V, ISO15693/FeliCa, limited emulation, and custom-mode scope; it does not affect the base BOM. `FND-0016` is closed at requirement level by explicit three-tier gates and by rejecting universal clone, one-frontend relay, key-recovery, LF 125 kHz, and payment-compliance overclaims. The exact U216 IC is NRND, and exact-revision/lifecycle, 5 V `PORT.A-NFC` (`FND-0015`), driver/SBOM, protocol, and HIL proof remain open implementation work.

The consumer-IR slice [`REQ-IR-0001`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/requirements/REQ-IR-0001-consumer-infrared.md) is **Reviewed** under `REV-0002S`. The owner accepted `IMP-0015/A` as [`DEC-0018`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/decisions/DEC-0018-dual-path-consumer-ir.md): C5 uses TSOP38238 for robust demodulated 38 kHz receive and TSMP95000 for measured-carrier learning from 30 to 60 kHz, consuming both C5 RX RMT channels; TSAL6200 is the first conditional 940 nm emitter candidate. Cheaper single-learning/fixed-38 variants lose an accepted capability and cannot be substituted silently. `FND-0018` is closed at requirement level; automatic 455 kHz/out-of-band learning remains deferred. Own remote/replay is Main, passive analysis is Lab, unknown replay is Controlled Zone `AUTHORIZED_TARGET`, and TV-B-Gone/brute-force/multi-code sweep is Controlled Zone `BOTH`. `FND-0017`, C5 pins/transport, exact BOM, STOP, optics, licences and HIL remain open implementation work.

The 3×nRF24 prerequisite audit is **Reviewed** under `REV-0002T`, and final propagation under `REV-0002U` makes [`REQ-N24-0001`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/requirements/REQ-N24-0001-three-nrf24-raw-2g4.md) **Reviewed**. The owner accepted `IMP-0016/A` as [`DEC-0019`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/decisions/DEC-0019-calibrated-rpd-three-antenna-hunt.md): three simultaneous paths provide calibrated binary RPD hit-rate sector comparison with sampling/calibration metadata, never RSSI/dBm/bearing/VSWR; real-power hardware remains a separate future decision. `FND-0020` is closed at requirement level. Current hardware remains S3-routed and no active C5 driver/security state machine/HIL exists, so `FND-0019` and `FND-0021` remain open. Passive ESB/MouseJack discovery, sensitive KeySniffer capture, active injection, address brute-force, and interference tests retain separate gates; interference/carrier sweeps are conducted or RF-shielded `BOTH` only, and GPL references are not treated as MIT-reusable code. **⚠️ Proposal [`IMP-0017`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/improvements/IMP-0017-native-ble-plus-nrf24-compatibility.md)** is deferred to BLE-owner review.

The C5 Wi-Fi/IEEE 802.15.4 prerequisite audit is **Reviewed for prerequisites** under [`REV-0002V`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/reviews/REV-0002V-c5-wifi-802154-prerequisites.md). Public promiscuous RX is separated from limited raw TX and any private patched binary; simultaneous dual band, arbitrary management injection, DFS SoftAP, and full/lossless monitor are not promised. Country/DFS/PMF/privacy and one-radio coexistence are mandatory gates. Raw 802.15.4, OpenThread, and Zigbee roles need no new RF BOM, but the Zigbee core is proprietary prebuilt. [`REQ-W5-0001`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/requirements/REQ-W5-0001-c5-wifi-ieee802154.md) remains **In review**. **⚠️ Proposal [`IMP-0018`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/improvements/IMP-0018-open-first-thread-and-zigbee-scope.md)** asks for open-first Thread plus conditional Zigbee, open-only Thread/raw, or passive-only. The target README remains unchanged pending the owner's answer.

## Deferred architecture gate

[`IMP-0010`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/improvements/IMP-0010-hardware-stop-and-expander-consolidation.md) remains open, but [`DEC-0012`](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2/blob/main/docs/review/decisions/DEC-0012-defer-imp-0010-to-pin-budget.md) defers the A/B choice to stage 3. No owner decision is requested until a consolidated pin/GPIO/resource budget covers both MCUs, expanders, fixed-function pins, inter-MCU transport, audio, UI/touch, external modules, and genuinely freed onboard GNSS/LoRa lines.

`FND-0006` and `FND-0007` remain open. The deferral neither selects `U14`/the 3×3 matrix nor proves a hardware STOP.
